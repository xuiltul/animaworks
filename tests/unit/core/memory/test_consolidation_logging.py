"""Unit tests for consolidation logging — placeholder after refactor.

The original tests verified _summarize_episodes prompt content and
_merge_to_knowledge logging. Those methods have been removed from
ConsolidationEngine as part of the consolidation refactor (the Anima
now drives consolidation via its tool-call loop).

This file is intentionally left with no tests to avoid import/collection
errors from test runners that discover it by path.
